# AI Agents for Kingdomino

This repository contains implementations AI agents for playing the
game of Kingdomino. The agents were used for the experiments in the
scientific article "Monte Carlo Methods for the Game Kingdomino" by
M. Gedda, M.Z. Lagerkvist, and M. Butler. The article is accepted for
publication at the IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and
Games 2018 (CIG 2018).

The agents are implemented in Java and use a small amount of
optimizations. The aim of the article was to examine and compare
different strategies rather than creating a fully optimized
implementation.

The agents use a REST API to communicate with a Kingdomino game
server. The server implementation can be downloaded from
[https://github.com/mratin/kdom-ai](https://github.com/mratin/kdom-ai
"Kingdomino server").

## Note

The implementations should not be viewed as idiomatic code. They are
written to solve specific problems and do not pretend to follow
industry code conventions or design principles.
